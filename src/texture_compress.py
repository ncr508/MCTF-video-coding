# Compress textures (temporal subbands) generated in the analysis
# phase. The number of bits allocated depends on the "quality"
# parameter, begin 0.0 the minumun quality.

# To determine the slopes which must be applied to each temporal
# subband (the slope for each subband-layer), it must be known that
# typically, the quality of an image/temporal-subband is reduced with
# an increment in the slope, linearly:
#
#  PSNR[dB]
#     ^
#   50| \
#     | :\
#     | : \
#     | :  \
#   20| :   \
#     | :    :
#     +-+----+-> Slope
#       40K 50K
#
# So, supposing that all temporal subbands have been compressed using
# the same slopes, and that this holds for each quality layer,
# decreasinging the slope in a constant amount (using for example the
# slope 50000 for the first quality layer of each temporal subband, slope
# 50000-X for the second quality layer of each temporal subband, slope
# 50000-2X ...), we can apply the subband gains considering that a given
# number of subband-layers of a low-frequency temporal subband should
# be "transmitted" before the first subband-layer of a
# higher-frecuency temporal subband.
#
# To determine such number, we can use the fact that a linear
# decrement in the slope produces a linear increment in the
# quality. Thus,for example, if we have Q subband-layers and a total
# increment (decoding all the subband-layers) in quality of x dB
# (inside the subband), each subband-layer constributes with an
# increment of x/Q dB, and this is true for all the subband-layers of
# each temporal subband because the total range of quality of all
# subbands is the same.
#
# For example, if TRLs=2, temporal subband L1 should contribute to the
# reconstruction of the GOP (to the output code-stream) approximately
# 1.25 times more than temporal subband H1. If Q=8, each subband-layer
# of L1 and H1 contributes with x/8 = 0.125*x dB. Therefore, it is
# easy to see that the optimal order for the subband-layers of these
# temporal subbands should be:
#
# L1.l7 (= Subband-layer 7 of temporal subband L1) which increases x/8
# dB the quality of each GOP.
#
# L1.l6 which produces a total increase of x/8 + x/8 = x/4 = 0.25*x dB
# in the quality of each GOP.
#
# At this point, we can "transmit" the next subband-layer of L1 or the
# first subband-layer of H1 (after having "transmitted" the
# corresponding subband-layer of M1). Experimentally we have
# determined that is better (in general) to "transmit" the next
# subband-layer of L1: L1.l5.
#
# M1.
#
# H1.l7, L1.l4, H1.l6, L1.l3, H1.l5, ...
#
# In terms of slopes, if MAX_SLOPE (50K) generates the minimum
# quality, we should use a slope "quantization_step" for subband H1
# and the slope:
#
# MAX_SLOPE - quality*Q/GAIN[1][0]
#
# for L1, where Q is the number of quality layers and GAIN[1][0] is
# the energy gain of subband L1 compared to H1.
#
# In general, for temporal subband "t", we have:
#
# MAX_SLOPE - GAIN[TRLs][t]*quantization_step*Q
#
# The quality of the recontruction is controlled by the
# quantization_step parameter. If quantization_step=1 we get the
# minimum quality. The higher the quantization step, the higher the
# quality (in the range of slopes [40K, 50K] approximately.
#
# Examples:
#
#   mctf transcode_quality --qstep=50

#to each subband depends on
#  the "slopes" parameter, which controls the quality of each quality
#  layer (such as a quantization factor) in each image of each
#  subband. Therefore, the number of quality layers equals the
#  number of slopes. The optimal bit-rate control should be performed
#  in decompression time using the "extract" program (See
#  transcode.py).
